# Asif_FinalProject
### There are a couple of ways to approach this project. The First thing that came to my mind was to create the object. After creating the object the next step was to get the button working and the "error handling". I used an If statement for the error handling. The next step was to retrieve the information from the user and printing it out. The last step was for the values to be cleared out so that the next input could be placed. One of the harder parts of this assignment was to delete the event and to get the strike through to work. For example my strike through wasn't working because of the paranthesis being in the wrong place. This reminds me going throught the whole cand and debugging was really important. The placements of pranthesis make a lot of difference. Sometimes my project wouldn't work and and the reason for that was the incorrect placements. Another thing that helped was the console. Everytime there is an error, sometimes the console would let you know what the error was. The project itself wasn't to bad, My notes and old assignments really helped as I forgot the styling of differennt methods. My interactive project helped a lot with that and it also helped me with the css.
